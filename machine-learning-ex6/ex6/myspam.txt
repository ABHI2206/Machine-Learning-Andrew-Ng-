Hi all,

I would like to invite you to another online live Facebook Office Hours Monday November 5 at 1PM Eastern time. Here is the Facebook Event:

We will talk about whatever comes up. I would be happy to talk about any of the Python courses, the Web Applications for Everybody Specialization, or even last week's Teach Out on the Internet and You. You could even ask me why I chose PHP to teach as the first web application language :)

My last Face-to-Face Office hour was in Raleigh, NC, several weeks ago:

Hope to see you Monday at 1PM Eastern in Facebook Live.
